# VBA-Challenge

VBA Challenge

This project analyzed stock market data for three years(2014, 2015, 2016) using VBA.
The goal is to create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information:

- The ticker symbol.

- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock.

About the Script
You can find the script inside the VBAStocks folder of this repository. The script file is called Multiple_year_stock_data_KM.xlsm.

Sample Output
After the script has completed, go to the Excel workbook, and you should see the results of the script.

Here are screenshots of what the output looks like when I ran the scripts on my computer. These screenshots are also available in the VBAStocks/screenshots folder of this repository.
